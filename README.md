# Panic-in-Detroit-VideoGame-2D-
It's a 2D game in which a soldier finds himself in an apocalyptic world and must find a cure for a disease.  

On his adventure, he'll face various enemies and earn rewards that he can redeem from merchants.

In addition, the soldier will be able to find different chests along his way, which will make the challenge easier, obtaining bullets and coins.


Finally, at the end of the path there will be a large, challenging enemy that you will have to defeat wisely.


Soundtrack comes from the video game The Last of Us and DeadCells.
